        <p>An HTML table is a fundamental component of web development used to organize and present data in rows and columns on a web page. It consists of one or more rows, each containing cells arranged into columns. Tables are created using HTML markup, with elements such as &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, and &lt;td&gt; defining the structure, rows, header cells, and data cells respectively. HTML tables provide a structured layout that helps users interpret data more efficiently and are commonly used for tasks such as displaying data sets, creating forms, and designing layouts on websites.</p>
